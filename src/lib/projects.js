This was a group project, however, I was involved in every part of the app. The back-end was built using Django, Django-Rest-Framework and Python. The front-end was built using React Hooks throughout. I took charge of the Jobs, Contacts and Resources. As well as building the reusable Hooks components such as the modals for creation and deletion of items. For this project, we decided to use Semantic UI CSS framework for the styling',

Our group decided that we all wanted to be involved in the full-stack for this project. I took charge of the hikes for both front-end and back-end. The model was created based around CRUD features using MongoDB and Express. The frontend was built using React and Bulma/SASS for the styling. I made use of multiple third-party React packages including React.Moment, React-Mapbox-GL and React-Rating-Stars.',
