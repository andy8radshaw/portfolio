        <p>A Junior Software Engineer embarking on my first role at <a href="https://www.reachplc.com/home" target="_blank" className="content-link">Reach Plc.</a> Previously graduating
        from General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive course, where I obtained a strong
        understanding of modern programming languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js & Python. My
        journey into software engineering came from a love of problem solving and a fascination and curiosity for
        all things tech.
        </p><br/>
        
        <p>Before all this coding took off, I worked in the audio industry for 10 years, designing and selling sound
        systems into shops, offices, stadiums and churches. Projects I&apos;ve worked on include; Harrods, Kings
        Collage Chapel Cambridge, Body Worlds Ldn and many others. My time in the audio world has taught me a
        great deal
        about being adaptable, working as part of a team and delivering excellent results on time in an agile
        environment. In my new role at Reach I will continue on the path of development, improving my
        skills, and aim to become a valued and creative member of the team.</p><br/>
        <p>Please get in <a href='#contact' className="content-link" onClick={handleContactModal}>contact</a> if you are interested in working with me. Likewise, if you
        would like some advice about your sound system or just want to chat guitars. Gibson ES-335 if you&apos;re
        asking...</p>
